                <li>Spiders are arachnids that belong to the class Arachnida and the order Araneae.
                    They are known for their characteristic eight legs and ability to produce silk.
                </li>
                <li>There are over 48,000 known species of spiders found worldwide, inhabiting
                    diverse habitats such as forests, deserts, and even underwater environments.
                </li>
                <li>Spiders are predators that primarily feed on insects and other small arthropods.
                    They use their venomous fangs to inject venom into their prey, paralyzing or
                    killing them.
                </li>
                <li>Some species of spiders, like the orb-weaving spiders, create intricate webs to
                    capture their prey, while others, like hunting spiders, rely on their keen
                    senses to actively hunt down their prey.
