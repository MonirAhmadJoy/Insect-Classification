            <li>Grasshoppers are herbivorous insects belonging to the suborder Caelifera, characterized by their ability to jump long distances due to their strong hind legs.</li>
            <li>They are found in various habitats worldwide, including grasslands, meadows, and forests, and are known for their distinctive appearance with long antennae and large compound eyes.</li>
            <li>Grasshoppers play important ecological roles as both prey and predators in the food chain, contributing to the balance of ecosystems.</li>
            <li>They communicate through chirping sounds produced by rubbing their wings or legs together, which serves as a means of attracting mates or warning signals to other grasshoppers.</li>
