        Grasshoppers are a group of insects
        belonging to the suborder Caelifera. They are among what is possibly the most
        ancient living group of chewing herbivorous insects, dating back to the early
        Triassic around 250 million years ago.

        Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have
        eight legs, chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom,
        [2] and spinnerets that extrude silk.[3] They are the largest order
        of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of
        organisms.

        Mosquitoes (or mosquitos) are members of a group of almost 3,600
        species of small flies within the family Culicidae (from the Latin culex
        meaning "gnat").[1] The word "mosquito" (formed by mosca and diminutive -ito)
        [2] is Spanish for "little fly".[3][4] Mosquitoes have a slender segmented
        body, one pair of wings, one pair of halteres, three pairs of long hair-like
        legs, and elongated mouthparts.

        Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from
        the order Lepidoptera, which also includes moths. Adult butterflies have
        large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight.
        The group comprises the large superfamily Papilionoidea, which contains at
        least one former group, the skippers (formerly the superfamily "Hesperioidea").

        A dragonfly is a flying insect belonging to the infraorder
        Anisoptera below the order Odonata. About 3,000 extant species of true
        dragonfly are known. Most are tropical, with fewer species in temperate
        regions. Loss of wetland habitat threatens dragonfly populations around the
        world.
